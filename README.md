# FlyFiles: A File Sharing Application over the Web

FlyFiles is a LAN-based file transfer app that enables users to share files with ease. The app has been designed with convenience and security in mind, and it provides a fast and reliable way to transfer files between devices.

## Features

Here are some of the key features of FlyFiles:

- **UI design and development.** The app has a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy to use.
- **Mobile and desktop device detection.** FlyFiles detects the type of device you are using and optimizes the user interface accordingly.
- **Websockets connection.** The app uses Websockets to establish a connection between the sender and receiver devices.
- **WebRTC signalling and handshaking.** FlyFiles uses WebRTC to establish a secure connection between devices and ensure that files are transferred safely.
- **Sending file data through RTCDataChannels.** The app uses RTCDataChannels to transfer files between devices quickly and efficiently.
- **Recreating blobs on the end client to create the final file.** FlyFiles recreates the file on the receiver's device using the blobs received from the sender.
- **Alert for received files.** The app notifies the receiver when a file has been successfully transferred.
- **Private connections via your own LAN.** FlyFiles allows you to transfer files only with yourself by creating a private connection via your own LAN.

## Future Improvements

I have some exciting ideas for future upgrades that I hope to implement:

- **ID system.** An ID system will allow users to share files with each other easily across different networks.
- **Rooms for multiple people.** Users will be able to share files with an entire room, making it easier to collaborate on projects.
- **Improved security measures.** I are constantly working to improve the security of FlyFiles to ensure that your files are safe during transfer.
- **Enhanced UI design.** I are always looking for ways to improve the user experience of FlyFiles to make it even easier to use.

Thank you for considering FlyFiles for your file sharing needs. I hope you enjoy using the app! ðŸš€
